# StellarE SDK TIM_01

## TIM test

### Description: 
	TIM_01 generates a PWM using the ch1 of TIM1 with
	- frequency = 2Hz
	- duty cycle = 50%
	- active high
	A callback related to ch1 of TIM1 is defined and configured to blink the
	led USER_LED_A at the end of each duty cycle of the PWM waveform.
	Moreover, the test configures the ch2 of TIM1 as input capture. A callback
	related to ch2 of TIM1 is defined and configured to blink the USER_LED_B
	each falling edge of the input waveform.
	So, if the PWM waveform generated by the ch1 of TIM1 is used as input of
	the ch2 of TIM1, both user leds will blink simultaneously.
